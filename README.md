## What I Learned
I initially started designing this website with Bootstrap Studio but found it difficult to find support for some of the issues that I was experiencing. I eventually started my website with a basic [scrolling nav template](https://startbootstrap.com/templates/scrolling-nav/) with an MIT license and built off it by adding a lot of elements, custom css, and javascript - I did not just paste in my own content. I did take heavy inspiration from single page applications and portfolio websites.This project helped solidify my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and introduced me to several js libraries that made it easier to implement the visual effects that I wanted. I strengthened my skills in UI design through working heavily with CSS and Bootstrap. I learned about many CSS concepts such as transitions, animations, media queries, etc. Throughout the process I learned how to use Google Chrome's inspector too, which was tremendously helpful for diagnosing problems and see what was happening "under the hood". As a result of my inexperience, it took me quite a while to just diagnose the issue and describe it properly. I often found myself spending a lot of time on small issues, resulting in hours of scourering Google and Stack Overflow for answers. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed watching my website come to life!
